# Roland Fantom-0 Sound Library

I'm excited to share with you my latest project: a comprehensive sound library that I've created from scratch. I've put a lot of effort into crafting high-quality sounds. I'm sharing this library not only because I believe it can be useful to many of you, but also because I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions. So please, feel free to explore the library and let me know what you think!

[UpRightPiano1.svz](https://github.com/fdivitto/Roland-Fantom-0-Sound-Library/raw/main/UpRightPiano1.svz), 4 velocity layers (55, 68, 86, 110), 11 notes (C2, F2, B2, E3, A3, E4, G4, C5, F5, C6, F6), contains following tones:
